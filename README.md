## How to get K-Means to work
1. If you just click enter (no text entered), the program will use the "KMeansTest1.png"
2. For mode, enter "k-means", "kmeans", or "k"
3. You have a few more guided instructions: I'd recommend 6 for random spots and 40 for re-averaging.
4. Enjoy!

## Experimental Code
There is some experimental code around the re-averaging that might interest you. There were 2 things I was trying to do:

1. Make points "stick" to the side of blobs -- got it working, but didn't like it as much
2. Judge whether there were lines of VotingPoints from one average/anchor point to another

This one was pretty hard to do, and I was not able to get it fully working. I think that if both of these ran together, it could be pretty powerful, if you were willing to allot more random points (so each blob has multiple).
